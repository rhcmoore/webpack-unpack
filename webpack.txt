What is Webpack?
    * Holds our whole build workflow
    * A bundler (concatenating files) that can also ...
    * Optimize files
    * Hook in plugins and loaders
    * Transform files
    * Transpile next-gen JS to current gen JS

Core Ideas
    * Multiple files bundled together
    * Analyze connections (eg. imports) between files
    * Run additional logic to transform code
    * De-facto standard for setting up projects

How Webpack Works - In 4 Features
    1. Needs at least 1 entry point (eg. App.js)
        * For instance, the root JS file that mounts React app to the DOM
        * Needs file to analyze dependencies 
        * Build up a dependency graph and understand which files make up application

    2. Loaders (eg. babel-loader, css-loader)
        * Applied transformations on a per-file level / file-type dependent
        * eg. all JS files handled by this loader

    3. Plugins (eg. uglify)
        * Takes bundled/concat file (but still before output)
        * Apply general/global transformations

    4. Output (eg. dist/bundle.js)
        * Bundled dependencies output
        * In the correct order & concatenated

Basic Workflow Requirements (eg. create-react-app)
    * Compile next-gen JS Features
    * Handle JSX
    * CSS auto-prefixing
    * Support image imports
    * Optimize code (pre-bundle)
