### Webpack Unpack

Setting up a basic project with webpack as a build tool. I want to understand better what ```create-react-app``` does for us automatically.

Built to dig in to webpack, specifically babel, plugins, loaders, images in React, production workflow, and chunk files.

Using the following dependencies:
    "autoprefixer": "^7.1.5",
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.2",
    "babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import": "^6.18.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.6.0",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-preset-stage-2": "^6.24.1",
    "css-loader": "^0.28.7",
    "file-loader": "^1.1.5",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^2.30.1",
    "postcss-loader": "^2.0.7",
    "rimraf": "^2.6.3",
    "style-loader": "^0.19.0",
    "url-loader": "^0.6.2",
    "webpack": "^3.6.0",
