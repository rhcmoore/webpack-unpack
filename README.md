### Webpack Unpack

Setting up a basic project with webpack as a build tool. I want to understand better what ```create-react-app``` does for us automatically.

Built to dig in to webpack, specifically:
* babel, 
* plugins, 
* loaders, 
* images in React, 
* production workflow, and 
* chunk files

Using the following dependencies:
* autoprefixer
* babel-core
* babel-loader
* babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import
* babel-preset-env
* babel-preset-react
* babel-preset-stage-2
* css-loader
* file-loader
* html-webpack-plugin
* postcss-loader
* rimraf
* style-loader
* url-loader
* webpack
* webpack-dev-server
